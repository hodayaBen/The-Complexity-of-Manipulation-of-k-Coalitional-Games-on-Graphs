The datasets we used are from SNAP (https://snap.stanford.edu/index.html) [J. Leskovec and J. Mcauley. Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 539â€”-547, 2012]

We use the code from https://github.com/VieCut/VieCut for the executable file 'mincut' in the folder executables.
We use the code from https://github.com/ArthurRouquan/KargerSteinAlgorithm as a base for our karger implemntation.
